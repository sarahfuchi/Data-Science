### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently working on building up my GitHub profile with data science projects.  
- 🌱 I’m learning the basics of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Prediction (Regression), Prediction (Classification), Cluster analysis (Unclassified data) and Advanced data science (Deep Learning).
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any of the presented data-science projects or open to other projects. 
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with front end applications, ideally displaying the data-science results on a website. 
- 💬 Ask me anything data-science related, and I'll be happy to help you out. I love talking about this!
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy knitting when I'm not coding.

### Backround

I graduated from Tokyo Institute of Technology with a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering. I have worked at some of the top firms in the industry as a quality engineer, but I have found a new passion in data science. I started coding more often in order to improve my skills. I enjoyed automating tasks we commonly complete manually. My team definitely appreciated that! I started working on predictive analytics projects on my own, even though I wasn't assigned any. I came up with my own ideas, designed a solution, and started implementing them proactively.
